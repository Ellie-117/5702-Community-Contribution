# Package Prepare

## Installation
We recommend installing the full universe at once:
```{r}
install.packages("mlr3verse")
```

You can also just install the base package:
```{r}
install.packages("mlr3")
```

## Package Ecosystem
mlr3 makes use of the following packages not developed by core members of the mlr3 team:

R6: Reference class objects.
data.table: Extension of Râ€™s data.frame.
digest: Hash digests.
uuid: Unique string identifiers.
lgr: Logging facility.
mlbench: A collection of machine learning data sets.
evaluate: For capturing output, warnings, and exceptions.
future / future.apply: For parallelization.
These are core packages within the R ecosystem.

The mlr3 package itself provides the base functionality that the rest of ecosystem (mlr3verse) rely on and some fundamental building blocks for machine learning.
